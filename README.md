The Brain Games project contains 5 games. These games have a common structure. The player must answer 3 questions correctly to win. If the player gives an incorrect answer, the game ends.
1. The player answers 'yes' if the random number is even, if it isn't - 'no'.
2. The player calculates a random expression and enters the correct answer.
3. The player calculates and enters the greatest common divisor of two random numbers.
4. The player sees a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression. One number is always missing. The player finds and enters this number.
5. The player answers 'yes' if the random number is prime, if it isn't - 'no'.
